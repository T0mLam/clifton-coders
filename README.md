# ESG-Agent ü§ñüå±  
**A multi-agent AI workforce for real-time ESG compliance reporting**  
*@MachineTalents X UM Hackathon @ Google project proposal from Clifton Coders*
> Let‚Äôs make ESG smarter, faster, and more accessible‚Äîtogether. üåç

## üåç 1 Why ESG-Agent?  
Every listed company must now disclose Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) metrics‚Äîbut the data is fragmented across APIs, PDFs, and breaking news. Manual workflows burn analyst hours and still miss fast-moving controversies.

**ESG-Agent** replaces that grind with an autonomous ‚ÄúAI workforce‚Äù that gathers data, scores risk, and produces an executive-ready report in **seconds, not days**, tailored for startups, small-scale companies, and individuals.
